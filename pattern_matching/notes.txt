Refutable Patterns:

    Patterns that might fail to match some values.
    Example: Some(x) in if let Some(x) = a_value. It will fail if a_value is None.

Irrefutable Patterns:

    Patterns that always match any value.
    Example: let x = 5;. It always matches and binds x to 5.

Usage Restrictions:

    Irrefutable Patterns: Can be used with let, function parameters, and for loops.
    Refutable Patterns: Can be used with if let and while let. Rust warns against using them in contexts expecting irrefutable patterns.

Common Errors:

    Refutable Pattern in let: Example let Some(x) = some_option_value; will not compile because let requires irrefutable patterns.
    Irrefutable Pattern in if let: Example if let x = 5 { ... } generates a warning because if let is intended for refutable patterns and x always matches.

Handling Refutable Patterns:

    Use if let or while let for patterns that might not match, allowing the code to handle non-matching cases gracefully.

Match Arms:

    Use refutable patterns in match arms except the final arm, which should be an irrefutable pattern to handle any remaining values.

Warnings and Errors:

    Rust generates warnings or errors when patterns are used inappropriately, helping guide correct usage in different contexts.
